# Demo - Postgres / Debezium / RabbitMQ 

This project was created with a focus on showcasing the utilization of the Debezium tool to implement a Change Data Capture (CDC) process. It effectively tracks data changes and synchronizes information with various destinations such as databases, indexers, private data stores, disks, etc.

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used in databases to identify and capture changes (additions, updates, or deletions) made to the data. Instead of continuously scanning the entire database, CDC allows you to track and capture only the data that has changed since the last check. This helps in efficiently managing and replicating updates, reducing the workload on the database and improving overall performance.

Here, you'll discover setup files, docker-compose configurations, and additional resources intended to serve as a motivational starting point for your real-world projects.
